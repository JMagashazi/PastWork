An assignment for my advanced SQL class.

I was required to create a simulation of a kanban setup in a factory setting.  This simulation was to run entirely within SQL Server.

The simulation was to run for 92 hours subjective time.  Most of my classmates created polling solutions that would take in excess of 20 minutes to execute.  I came up with an event notification system that could run in seconds.
